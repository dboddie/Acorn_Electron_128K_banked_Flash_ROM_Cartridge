Notes on the licence choice and its application to this work
------------------------------------------------------------

Although the above statement refers to a "program", the licence itself uses
this term to refer to "any copyrightable work". In this case, the work
consists of schematics, circuit layout details and other data, and the
application of this licence is intended to govern the further distribution of
these materials in addition to any programs or software that might also be
included in the work.

When making hardware using the materials featured in this work, be sure to
provide corresponding sources (schematics, circuit layouts) or to make them
available on request, as indicated by the licence terms. Where a modified form
of the work is distributed, the relevant changes must be incorporated into the
source files that were actually edited to produce the desired, modified
result.

It is not generally acceptable to provide only modified output files when
distributing modified forms of this work. For example, it is not acceptable to
change the circuit layout file in a PCB editing program and then withhold this
modified file from recipients by insisting that only the Gerber files were
edited directly. Only if the Gerber files were actually edited directly may
modified versions of such files be considered source-level changes. Even then,
such modifications on files that are the product of other, more abstract,
files are not recommended as they rarely uphold a sustainable development
approach.

To conclude, when producing unmodified versions of this work, you should make
these materials available to recipients. When producing modified versions, you
should make the exact materials you used available to recipients.

You should preserve the copyright and licensing notices present in this work
regardless of any modifications you make to the work. However, where a
copyright notice appears on the hardware itself (being analogous to a message
that a program might display to communicate such information to its users), you
may choose to extend the notice to take your modifications into account, or you
may choose to replace it with a reference to a resource providing all
applicable copyright and licensing information.
